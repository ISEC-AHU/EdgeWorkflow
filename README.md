## IMPORTANT
Please check the `improv` branch for latest changes. Master branch has been left intact until complete testing.

## How to run EdgeWorkflowReal ?

* Create a Java project in Eclipse.
* Inside the project directory, initialize an empty Git repository with the following command
* we provide a Web UI so that users can access EdgeWorkflowReal remotely and run their created edge workflow applications on our provided computing infrastructure. Web URL: http://47.98.222.243/EdgeWorkflowReal
```
git init
```
* Add the Git repository of EdgeWorkflowReal as the `origin` remote.
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/ISEC-AHU/EdgeWorkflowReal
```
* Pull the contents of the repository to your machine.
```
git pull origin master
```
* Run the example files (e.g. MainUI.java) to get started.
